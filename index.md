- The website must be public.
- Use at least a handful of Github flavour markdown features to format the web page.
- Document your work progress with a few screenshots to the learning diary.
- Write the Github page address to the learning diary so that your peer reviewers can verify it easily.
- Keep the pages available until you have received your course grade.
